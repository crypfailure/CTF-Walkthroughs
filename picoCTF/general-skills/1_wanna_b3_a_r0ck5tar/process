- download the file lyrics.txt
- that file contains the code in rockstar language
- it is similar to previous challenge mus1c but this challenge takes input too
- if you familiar with rockstar language then it great!! but if you aren't then don't worry, I don't know it either. Lets learn together
- we will translate rockstar code into python by using rockstar-py(https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py.git)
- after conversion, we try to run that code but it wont run successfully and showing some syntax error
- time for debugging and resolves those errors, here we have to make the syntax correct only
- finally, your code will look like this:

```
Rocknroll = True
Silence = False
a_guitar = 19
Tommy = 44
Music = 160
the_music = input()
if int(the_music) == a_guitar:
    print("Keep on rocking!")
    the_rhythm = input()
    if int(the_rhythm) - Music == 0:
        Tommy = 66
        print(Tommy)
        Music = 79
        Jamming = 78
        print(Music)
        print(Jamming)
        Tommy = 74
        print(Tommy)
        #They are dazzled audiences
        print(it)
        Rock = 86
        print(it)
        Tommy = 73
        print(it)
        #break
        print("Bring on the rock!")
    else:
        print("That ain't it, Chief")
        #break

```
- when we run this code and passing 19 as its first input, it will show "Keep on rocking!"
- now enter second input 160, it will print some number and crashed bcz "it" is not defined
- output will be like this
```
19
Keep on rocking!
160
66
79
78
74
Traceback (most recent call last):

    print(it)
NameError: name 'it' is not defined

```
- if we match these nuumbers, there are all those number that are mentioned in our script except 86 and 73
- now we will add those two number manually 

```
>>> flag =  """ 66
... 79
... 78
... 74
... 86
... 73
... """
>>> 
>>> flag
' 66\n79\n78\n74\n86\n73\n'
>>> 
>>> for x in flag.split():
...     print(chr(int(x)), end = '')
... 
BONJVI>>> 


```

FLAG: picoCTF{BONJVI}
