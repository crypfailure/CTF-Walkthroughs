- make some changes in code
- comment out the user input
- open a "dictionary.txt" file
- add a loop over that file
- strip the file's item
- code will look like this

```
def level_5_pw_check():
    #user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")

    f = open("dictionary.txt", "r")
    for x in f:
        user_pw = x.strip()
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)

        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")



```
